            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The new National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020) introduced by the
                central government is expected to bring profound changes to education in India. The policy approved by
                the Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of India's new education system.The new
                policy replaces the 1986 National Policy on Education. The policy is a comprehensive framework for
                elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and urban India.
                The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2021.
                The National Education Policy 2020 has emphasised on the use of mother tongue or local language as the
                medium of instruction till Class 5 while, recommending its continuance till Class 8 and beyond.It also
                states that no language will be imposed on the students.[31]The language policy in NEP is a broad
                guideline and advisory in nature; and it is up to the states, institutions, and schools to decide on the
                implementation.Education in India is a Concurrent List subject.</p>
